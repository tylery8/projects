# FanDuel Optimizer

<p>This program takes a csv lineup template downloaded from www.fanduel.com and fills in the template with the optimal lineup according to player projections provided by www.fantasypros.com. The optimizer currently supports FanDuel NFL contest formats of Full Roster, Single Game, SuperFlex, and 3-Man Challenge.</p>

<p>To use the optimizer:</p>
<ul>

<li>Run the fanduel/Reader.java file. This will automatically edit the csv to fill it with the optimal lineup
<li>Upload the lineup template csv to the contest slate on FanDuel
</ul>

<p>Alternatively, a sample lineup template csv from Week 8, 2019 is provided in this folder</p>
