#Chess
<p>Two player chess program with an AI playing as black. The AI is implemented with a minimax algorithm, alpha-beta pruning, move ordering, and quiescence search. By default, it searches at a depth ranging from 4 to 8 ply as determined by the quiescence search. The evaluation function uses default piece values combined with my personal positional evalutation of pieces for the opening, middle, and endgame. No opening or endgame books are used.</p>
